# Assignment Tracker — LMS Content Team

**Internal use only. Content development team tracking.**

This tracker manages authorship and delivery of LMS-facing content (guidelines, curriculum modules, rubrics). It is not visible to learners and is not a submission system for intern work. Interns submit coursework through the LMS platform; this tracker tracks who creates the course content itself.

| ID | Modality | Topic / Category | Subtask | Assigned to | Status | Due Date | Notes |
|----|----------|------------------|---------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1  | Audio    | Week 3 Prompting  | Expand Day 15–17 examples |  | not-started |  |  |
| 2  | Audio    | Week 3 Prompting  | Create Day 18–19 category prompts |  | not-started |  |  |
| 3  | Audio    | Week 3 Prompting  | Capstone testing & rubric |  | not-started |  |  |

## How to Use This Tracker

### Claiming a Task (Ownership)
1. Find an available task (Status = `not-started`).
2. Edit this file: add your name under **Assigned to** and change Status to `in-progress`.
3. Set a realistic **Due Date** (or leave blank if TBD).
4. Commit your change with message: `Task #[ID] claimed by [Name]`.

### Updating Task Status
- **not-started:** Task is available, no one assigned.
- **in-progress:** Someone is actively working on it.
- **submitted:** Work is complete and ready for review.
- **approved:** Reviewers have signed off; task is done.
- **blocked:** Task is stalled; use **Notes** to explain blocker.

### Completing a Task
A task is complete when:
1. Deliverable is in the repository (file, document, or update).
2. Deliverable meets the quality criteria stated in the task description (Subtask column).
3. You have run the validation checklist (if applicable).
4. You set Status to `submitted` and add a brief comment in **Notes** (e.g., "Files ready in prompt-guides/").
5. Lead reviewer marks Status as `approved`.

### Adding New Tasks
1. Use the next available ID number.
2. Fill in all columns: Modality, Topic, Subtask, Due Date.
3. Leave **Assigned to** blank and set Status to `not-started`.
4. Commit with message: `New task #[ID]: [Subtask description]`.

### Notes Column
Use for:
- Brief blockers ("Waiting for design feedback").
- File locations ("See prompt-guides/WEEK3_AUDIO_PROMPTING.md").
- Quality issues flagged during review.

## Principles

- **One task = one person.** Do not split ownership; coordinate via comments if needed.
- **Status is authoritative.** If Status ≠ your actual work status, update immediately.
- **Due dates are soft targets.** Adjust if needed, but communicate delays in advance.
- **Transparency over perfection.** Report blockers and setbacks in Notes; do not hide them.

## Tasks-to-Deliverables Mapping

This section clarifies how content team tasks map to LMS-facing documents and learner experience.

| Task ID | Content Team Deliverable | LMS-Facing Document | Learner Use |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 1       | Expanded Day 15–17 example prompts | `WEEK3_AUDIO_PROMPTING.md` | Learners study examples; used in Week 3 curriculum |
| 2       | Category prompt guidance (Day 18–19) | `WEEK3_AUDIO_PROMPTING.md` | Learners learn 7 audio categories; used in weekly assignments |
| 3       | Capstone evaluation rubric | `PRODUCTIVITY_METRICS.md` (updated) | Week 4 grading criteria; learners see rubric before capstone |

**Process:**
1. Content team member completes task and marks `submitted`.
2. Lead reviewer validates quality (peer score ≥ 3.5) and marks `approved`.
3. Approved content is integrated into LMS course (typically within 2 days).
4. Learners access via LMS; they do not see this tracker.
